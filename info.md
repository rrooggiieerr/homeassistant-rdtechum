# Home Assistant RDTech UM series USB load meter integration

Home Assistant integration to control RDTech UM series USB load meters over
Bluetooth.

## Hardware

The RDTech UM24C, UM25C and UM34C are USB load meters which can measure
various properties for USB devices including their voltage, amperage, wattage,
resistance, capacity, temperature, data line voltage, and charging mode.

##  Adding a new RDTech UM series USB load meter
New Nut BLE tracker devices will automatically be detected after the
integration has been installed.

## Credits
This integration has been been developed by Rogier van Staveren.

Special thanks go to William Vallet for creating the
[Python UM meter library](https://github.com/valletw/pyummeter) which this
integration heavily relies on
